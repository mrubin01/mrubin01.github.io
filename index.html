### About me
My background is in the BI field where I worked as a BI developer and data analyst using SQL Server, T-SQL, Qliksense and some other visualization tools. Yet, I would like to transition into the data science or in the quantitative finance field as I find fascinating the ability to predict or estimate what could happen. These two fields have a lot in common, to the point that often they overlap: probability theory, statistical modelling, linear algebra are among the theoretical pillars behind the data science and the quantitative finance. 

Starting from my dissertation at the university (Machine Learning for passive investing) I started working on several personal projects in the field of the Fintech. I used python and c++. There are some other projects that are currently private because the results are poor.   
Open to junior or entry-level positions.
